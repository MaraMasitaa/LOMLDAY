        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Happy birthday to the most ugly creatures I've ever seen. Urmm Let me start again, happy birthday to the girl i love the most in the whole wide world, On this special occasion I would like to make a wish that my girl here reading this would grow up into a beautiful Definitely funnyass and honorable lawyer because she is gonna spent 4 years studying it so heck yeah! It's suck not being able to write letters to you on your birthday because i can literally write a whole essay on how much a good friend i am to you. But this year it's gotta be different. I want to adore you completely. To my uncle sohail and aunty fatima thank you so much for falling in love and gave birth to this wonderful human being whom i am so fucking proud to call her my bestie. Uncle sohail and aunty fatima love story is better than romeo and juliet. Two people from different country falling in love against all odds and have a happy ending up till now so its prove to me that my love story with Lucas wong would be a fairytale too. Aleena ahhhh- I really miss you every now and then. I spent more than half of my life with you, you've been there for me all phases in my life but now that im in university i lost you. the distance was so fucked up. I hate how far we are but just like i often said before, im super thankful that distance separate us not death nor betrayal because i cant imagine losing someone like you for the rest of my life. We alwyays check on each other and rooting for each other. You know even if the whole world is against you, theres always me who will always root for you even though you are wrong as always. we will always be iconic duo. so right now let me properly wish you, studying law is definitely tough but i know you can do it. what's tougher than egg curry attitudes(inner jokes). You'll be all on your own, i wasnt there waiting for you and going lunch with you, im not going to be the one who sleep on your shoulder and listen to all your recent books rant.Im not there to agree with you on all your ideas or when u want to judge someone i wasnt there to judge with u. You are not going to beat me when you laugh anymore so in short, we both are going to have our own adventure so let's enjoy it. University life is our year alright! lets have fun and Let's meet each other when we both are satified with our life like promised. I will never find your replacement, you will always have a special place in my heart. You will never find someone like me either because there's only one Masita Mara who is close to perfection.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">-MASITA MARA-</p>
